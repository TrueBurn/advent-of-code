# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles released from December 1st to December 25th.

## 🚀 Leaderboard Dashboard

A custom leaderboard visualization dashboard is available in the `leaderboards` directory. Features include:

- Interactive JSON file upload for leaderboard data
- Key statistics:
  - Total participants and stars
  - Median stars per participant
  - Number of participants who completed all available days
  - Number of participants who haven't started yet
- Fastest completion times for each day
- Visual progress tracking for each participant
- Time-based completion graphs
- Responsive design with dark theme
- Scroll-to-top functionality

To use the dashboard:
1. Go to your private leaderboard on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
2. Click the [JSON] link to download your leaderboard data
3. Open `leaderboards/default.html` in a browser
4. Upload your JSON file using the file picker

### Previous Years
- **2024**: ✅ Complete (25/25 ⭐⭐)
- 2023: Not Attempted
- 2022: Not Attempted
- 2021: Not Attempted
- 2020: Not Attempted

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Install Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This installs:
- **Black** (code formatter)
- **Flake8** (linter)
- **isort** (import sorter)
- **pytest** (testing framework)
- **pytest-cov** (coverage reporting)

### Code Quality Checks

Run automated quality checks before committing:

```bash
# Check all Python files
./check_code_quality.sh

# Check specific directory
./check_code_quality.sh 2025/day-1
```

### Format Code

```bash
# Format with Black (line length: 100)
black --line-length 100 2025/day-1/solution.py

# Sort imports
isort --profile black 2025/day-1/solution.py
```

## 🏃 Running Solutions

### Quick Start for New Day

```bash
# Copy template
cp -r 2025/day-0 2025/day-X

# Navigate and implement
cd 2025/day-X
# Add puzzle input to input.txt
# Implement solution in solution.py

# Run quality checks
cd ../..
./check_code_quality.sh 2025/day-X

# Run solution
cd 2025/day-X
python solution.py
```

### Execute a Solution

```bash
cd 2025/day-1
python solution.py
```

Each day's solution is in its own directory with:
- `solution.py` - Main solution implementation
- `input.txt` - Puzzle input data
- `question.md` - Part 1 description
- `question-2.md` - Part 2 description (when applicable)
- `unit_tests.py` - Unit tests (for complex solutions)

## 📝 Code Standards

### Style Guidelines

- **Line length**: 100 characters max
- **Formatting**: Black (automatic)
- **Linting**: Flake8 (PEP 8 compliance)
- **Import sorting**: isort (Black profile)
- **Type hints**: Python 3.9+ type annotations
- **Testing**: unittest framework with pytest

### Solution Structure

Solutions follow a consistent pattern:
- `parse_input(input_file)` - Parse and structure input data
- `part1(input_file)` - Part 1 solution
- `part2(input_file)` - Part 2 solution
- `main()` - Orchestrates testing and execution

### Best Practices

- Clear and readable code over code-golfing
- Descriptive function and variable names
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Unit tests for non-trivial solutions
- Performance optimization when needed (memoization, efficient data structures)
- Design Part 1 with Part 2 extensibility in mind

### Template

Use `2025/day-0` as a template for new solutions:
- Pre-configured with proper structure
- Includes unit test framework
- Follows all coding standards
- Ready to copy and implement

## ⭐ Progress Tracking

- ⭐ = First part completed
- ⭐⭐ = Both parts completed
- Blank = Not started/In progress
