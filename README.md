## 🛠️ Running Solutions

1. Each day's solution is in its own directory
2. Input files are stored as `input.txt` in the respective day's directory
3. Problem descriptions are in `question.md` files
4. To run a solution:
   ```bash
   cd 2024/day-1
   python solution.py
   ```

## 📝 Notes

- Solutions aim to be clear and readable rather than code-golfed
- Each day's directory includes:
  - Solution code (`solution.py`)
  - Input data (`input.txt`)
  - Problem description (`question.md`)
  - Part 2 description (`question-2.md`) when applicable
  - Unit tests (`unit_tests.py`) for solutions that require them
    - Solutions with unit tests run tests before executing the actual solution
    - Tests verify both example cases and edge cases where applicable
